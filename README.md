## FinAPI (Constantly under development!)

This is a basic hobby project using Next.js and several financial APIs to test and perform experiments with APIs. The goal of this project is to create a simple yet functional finance application that can provide real-time financial data.

### Technologies Used

- **Financial APIs**: These are used to fetch both real-time and historical financial data. The APIs provide access to a wide range of data, including stock prices, forex rates, and financial news.

### Features
